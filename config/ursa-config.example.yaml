# Ursa Configuration Example
# Copy this file to ~/.ursa/config.yaml and customize
#
# This file defines:
# - AWS regions to scan for ParallelCluster instances
# - S3 bucket for each region (used for workset registration)

# Optional: Default AWS profile (can be overridden by AWS_PROFILE env var)
# aws_profile: lsmc

# Region to bucket mappings
# Each region should have a bucket in that region for data locality
regions:
  us-west-2:
    bucket: s3://your-bucket-us-west-2
    # enabled: true  # default

  us-east-1:
    bucket: s3://your-bucket-us-east-1

  eu-west-1:
    bucket: s3://your-bucket-eu-west-1

  # Disable a region without removing it
  # eu-central-1:
  #   bucket: s3://your-bucket-eu-central-1
  #   enabled: false
