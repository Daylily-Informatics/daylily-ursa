# Ursa Configuration Example
# Copy this file to ~/.ursa/ursa.yaml and customize
#
# This file defines:
# - AWS regions to scan for ParallelCluster instances
# - AWS profile and Cognito settings
#
# NOTE: S3 buckets are discovered from cluster tags (aws-parallelcluster-monitor-bucket)
# rather than being configured here. Each cluster's bucket is set during cluster creation.

# AWS profile to use (overridden by AWS_PROFILE env var if set)
aws_profile: lsmc

# List of AWS regions to scan for ParallelCluster instances
# Clusters in these regions will be available for workset execution
regions:
  - us-west-2
  - us-east-1
  - eu-central-1
  - ap-south-1

# Cognito configuration (overridden by env vars COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID, COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID)
# cognito_user_pool_id: us-west-2_xxxxxxxx
# cognito_app_client_id: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
